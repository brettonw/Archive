TO DO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-change text rendering to use the scanner to create lists of tokens
-double click to select words
-optimize rendering by adding a "text didn't change" flag - allows rendering only this page
-arrow keys, and delete keys ignore carriage return linefeed combos (treat as one character)

-join test registrar and task registrar to reduce code (add a panic capability)

-undo/redo (command manager)
-mark changed files with a * in the title bar
-ask about saving changes when quitting

-update code line formatting (comment lines between functions, etc.)

-my own file object, and streaming operators, to eliminate dependency on C++ rt library and
 homogenize the file handling codes

-find/replace
-Select all

-block indent
-line numbers or goto line
-protect read only files from editing
-reload files when changed (on activate)

-private settings files for different projects
-preferences

-right click brings up a menu
-info bar with cursor pos
-auto-completion based on parser information
-set-as-template new file template that is user selectable as default new format

-single instance of app (launch new files in same app when another instance is launched)
-html editor
-makefile editor
-row window (for project files, and error files)
-F1 for help (launch MSDN)

-update the bit_or and bit_and keywords
- vertical line @ 80 chars width to indicate print width
- navigation history when using find/Ctrl-F3 or other methods to jump around file, a back and forth button, or bookmarking capability


BUGS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-resizing window not updating scroll bars
-cpp scanner not properly recognizing preprocessor directives with space on start of line
-enter on a line that has whitespace in front should only add whitespace up to cursor position
-vista - application is going into a "not responding" state
